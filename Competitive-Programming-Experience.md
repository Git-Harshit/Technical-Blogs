# Competitive Programming

Programming involves writing code. There are many tasks and questions available that require implementation of a source code solution, referred to as "Problems" hereafter in this blog. These prove out as a good way to practice, learn or simply test out one's programming skills.

Competitive Programming is a sport of programming that offers Problems as challenges for coders and each such contest judges and ranks the solutions over its leaderboard on the submissions scored on the basis of factors such as code efficiency in terms of running time and space complexities, correctness of source determined against several Input-Output Test cases, submission time delay since the start of contest participation, size of code (Code Golfing), and many such parameters.

Knowledge of several algorithms and patterns helps in realizing the efficient solution either in parts or completely.

## Best Practices

* Study Programming language implementations, Data Structures and Algorithms to be prepared.
* Learn techniques like stress testing for debugging, fast Input-Output for processing large IOs.
    * Practices as Random Input Generation for comparing the result(s) of working solution (often Bruteforce) with the solution under test are used in stress-testing.
* Read the problem statement completely to understand all of its necessary information.
    * Check for constraints and time/memory limits.
    * Explanation for sample test cases may not guide on the right direction. Consider even some alternative ways of solving them than described.
* Prove solution for correctness
    * Check with any given sample test cases at least.
    * Think of an approach, do some rough work if required. Then try for any alternative approaches.
    * Stress Test solution with a naive, brute-force approach or with another correct solution if available to find any input with deviation.
* Upsolve questions after the contest ends.
* Go through editorials and other successful submissions for learning about better and alternative solutions.
* Solve some slightly higher difficulty rated problems from the contest archives, or go for virtual contests if ready to tackle maximum problems.
