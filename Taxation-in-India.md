# Taxation in India

* A financial year starts from the 1st date of April month and continues until the end date of March in the upcoming Calendar year.
* Taxes are to be paid and evaluated on earnings / profit every financial year, referred to as Income Tax. 
* Financial Year (FY 20(YY) - (YY+1)) = Assessment Year (AY 20(YY+1) - (YY + 2)). 
    * For example: FY 2023-24 = AY 2024-25
* Taxation is calculated in slabs that are taxed on a certain percentage determined by the Income Tax Department in the Ministry of Finance under the Government of India.
* Old Tax Regime is the prior taxation method with relatively higher tax rates and several permitted deductions from taxation, and New Tax Regime is a recent taxation method with relatively lower tax rates on income slabs and fewer deductions applicable.
* When a deduction is applicable, the deduction amount is subtracted from the claimed income and the remaining amount is considered as taxable income.
* Income Tax Return (ITR) offers the statement for the proof that one's income has been taxed for the chosen regime.
* Various ITR forms are available for filing. Different forms are available for differing cases of ITR filing.
    * ITR I (1st) to IV (4th) are for on-time filing.
    * ITR V (5th) to VII (7th) are for belated filing, that is, past the due date of filing.
* For individual earners having a taxable income (which crosses the Nil / 0% tax slab), the due date to file an ITR is the end of July which immediately follows the end of a Financial Year.
    * If this date is missed, ITR can still be filed for an FY with a late fee up to the end date of December month following it.
    * Example: For FY 2023-24, the due date of ITR for individual ITR is 31st July 2024, and it can be filed with a late fee up to 31st December 2024.
* Annual Information Statement (AIS) contains the list of all of the transactions and taxes associated with a PAN Card or Aadhar details available with the Income Tax Department.
* Income Tax Filing and verifying of return are both mandatory steps. e-filing and e-verify simplifies the process, enabling it online on the Income Tax Portal https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/.
    * e-Verify of an ITR shall be done up to 30 days after ITR filing.
* Many taxes exist, such as Income Tax, Wealth Tax, Goods and Services Tax (GST).
    * Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is applicable for the recipients Income, and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) is applicable for a selling price.
